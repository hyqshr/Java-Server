# Project 1 Essay

### Assignment Overview:

This assignment was focused on the implementation of a UDP and TCP server and client. The purpose of the assignment was to gain hands-on experience about implementing the two protocols. The assignment involved creating a server that holds a key value map that can be changed and access by the client. Communication protocols are crucial to distributed system to enable node to node conversation. It's important to make the communication robust enough to handle as much as edge cases.

### Technical Impression:

It was my first few time working with network protocols, and I found it to be a challenging and rewarding experience. While working on the assignment, I learned about the difference between TCP and UDP protocols and their respective use cases. I found there is a lot more I can do in terms of error handling, for different method in different protocols. I implement the key-value communication protocol based on "," and space for simplisity.   

A lot of modern framework don't require developer to deal with protocols so I think it's good to have experience to play around with the two protocals.
